# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

# number of cans = (wall height * wall width) Ã· coverage per can.
# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5
# number of cans = (2 * 4) Ã· 5
# = 1.6
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

# 2,4 = 2
# 3,9 = 6
# 7,13 = 19

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
